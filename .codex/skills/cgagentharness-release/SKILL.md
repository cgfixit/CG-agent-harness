# Release the macOS desktop

Follow `AGENTS.md`; read the README-linked `docs/DESKTOP.md`, `docs/RELEASING.md`,
`scripts/package-desktop.sh`, `scripts/verify-desktop-bundle.sh` and the current
desktop/Bundle/release workflows. Package committed source so `Resources/COMMIT`
is meaningful; identify the release version as well as the source SHA.
`CGAH_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` is only for marked development artifacts.

Build on Apple Silicon macOS with installed Xcode CLT and rustup toolchains from
both toolchain files. Install `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin`
standard libraries for both toolchains before a universal build. Use rustup Cargo
on PATH. Run `scripts/package-desktop.sh --universal` (optional `--dmg`).

The critical order is backend slices -> lipo -> sign universal backend -> compile
both desktop slices embedding that exact whole-file SHA256 -> lipo desktop -> sign
shell/bundle. Never re-sign the sidecar after its digest is embedded. The backend
remains a separate child; native commands must not become browser capabilities.

Verify the ZIP checksum, extract to a fresh directory with spaces, and run
`scripts/verify-desktop-bundle.sh '<extracted app>' universal '<release version>'`.
Verify the bundled version matches the planned release and both executables
contain arm64 and x86_64, nested signatures, resources and system-only linkage.
Run `scripts/test-desktop-backend.py` with `CGAH_TEST_BINARY` set to the packaged
backend. Run desktop policy tests and both dependency policies.

Launch the actual app with a disposable `CGAGENTHARNESS_HOME`, distinct from any
operator home. Record app PID, owned sidecar/listener, local model chat and shutdown.
Do not treat a shared listener as this bundle's process. GUI acceptance requires
actual WKWebView evidence; HTTP tests do not prove pixels, focus or native dialogs.
Intel cross-compilation, Rosetta execution and native Intel testing are different
claims. Do not silently install Rosetta or change TCC settings to fill an evidence gap.

Record acceptance limits before publication.
Bundle calls reusable desktop CI; tagged releases reuse it too. Match remote SHA,
workflow run, artifact COMMIT and checksums. PRs produce no Bundle artifacts;
for an unmerged candidate, run `desktop.yml` by hand on its branch. Scheduled/manual publication
requires main and a successful Bundle run at that SHA. The release planner
rejects prerelease tags. Check existing runs, tags and releases before dispatch.
Publication follows explicit user authorization. Never overwrite release assets
or tags after an ambiguous result.
Ad-hoc signing is not Developer ID signing or notarization; state that limitation.
