# Evidence-first investigation

Use this loop when a confident mistake would be costly. Shared operating,
security and delivery rules live in `AGENTS.md` and `INVARIANTS.md`; apply them
without repeating the whole checklist for a small change.

1. Define the requested outcome, exclusions and evidence that would establish
   completion. Test the premise before designing a fix.
2. Trace the actual entrypoint, configuration, state owner, callers and side
   effects. Treat memory, issues, review findings and documentation as leads.
   Separate product defects from environment, permission and provider failures.
3. Establish the input-to-effect path for a security finding or an equivalent
   workload baseline for a performance claim. Reproduce on the current revision;
   challenge findings that the production path cannot reach.
4. Fix the shared cause with existing helpers and boundaries. Select affected
   contracts from `cgagentharness-invariant-guard`; preserve their refusal paths.
5. Exercise changed behavior and inspect output and side effects. Use the local
   verification policy in `AGENTS.md`; lint workflow changes and reserve broad
   regression/platform coverage for hosted CI. A zero-test filter is NOT RUN.
6. Compare the result with the original scope and acceptance criteria. Continue
   independent work around blockers, and state the exact unresolved requirement.

## Evidence that cannot substitute for another layer

- Compilation or a health response does not establish behavior.
- Fake providers establish protocol handling, not live availability or quality.
- Browser checks do not establish packaged WKWebView behavior.
- Cross-compilation does not establish native execution on the other architecture.
- A passed check does not establish a current-head review or that an absent,
  disabled or skipped workflow ran.

Record the checkout/SHA, binary or artifact identity, commands and outcomes
needed to reproduce the claim. Label observations, inferences and unknowns;
keep credentials and operator data out of evidence.

## Delivery

Refresh base, open-PR overlap and exact heads before publication. Follow the
repository PR template and validator; a local commit or pushed branch does not
complete a request for a draft PR. Verify the published body and remote head.
When asked to monitor CI, follow that head to terminal results and distinguish
checks, reviews, unresolved threads and mergeability. A slow job is not a reason
to cancel it. Keep drafts unmerged unless explicitly authorized otherwise.
